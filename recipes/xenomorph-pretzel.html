    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Game over, man. LV-426 is covered with these freaky pods full of death with a side of horrific torture and a wafer thin mint of pissing your god damn pants if any member of your crew complains about a stomach ache. Not that there are any more of us here. I’m the last one. Hell, those crazy bastards even ate the androids. I’ve holed up here in the ship’s mess. I’d like to pretend I’m waiting for rescue, but since I vented all the fuel and we’re just tumbling in the black, I know I’m really just waiting to die. I’ve heard asphyxiation isn’t a bad way to go. I guess I’ll find out.</p>
    <p>My descriptions don’t do these things justice, and honestly, my chickenscratch drawings are so bad I can’t tell the difference between the aliens and an angry, carnivorous horse. You need to know, man. If you find my body, take a good, hard look at these pretzel rolls. If you see a two foot tall version, don’t go near these things. Drop whatever you’re doing and fucking run back to your own ship. You’re probably dead anyway, but I like to think you’ll survive long enough to get word back to the rest of the colonies.</p>
    <p>Look, all I have left is time to kill, so if you want to sculpt up some warnings of your own, here’s a recipe. Even if no one believes you, the rolls taste pretty darn good as burger buns. At least you can have a decent last meal.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 cups flour</li>
        <li>1 cup whole milk</li>
        <li>1 tbsp active dry yeast</li>
        <li>3 tbsp packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tsp table salt</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1 tsp green food coloring</li>
        <li>3 cups warm water</li>
        <li>1/3 cup baking soda</li>
        <li>2 tbsp kosher salt or coarse pretzel salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>Warm your milk up in a microwave until it’s the temperature of warm bathwater. Mine took about 20 seconds, but who knows what kind of crap equipment you have on your ship. Just test it with a finger. Not too hot, or else you’ll kill the yeast. You don’t want to do that. Those beasties are your only friends, now.</p>
    <p>Dump the yeast and milk into a bowl and halfheartedly mix them up. Go press your ear against the bulkheads or feel the floor for vibrations for the next 10 minutes. When you come back, the yeast will have bloomed into a healthy colony, unlike those poor bastards on LV-426.</p>
